## **Overview**

The VRV Security RBAC system is designed to manage users with different roles (Admin, Moderator, User). It ensures that only authorized users can access specific routes and perform actions based on their roles. The system is divided into two parts:

1. **Backend**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and role management.
2. **Frontend**: Provides an interactive user interface for user registration, login, and dashboard view, along with role-specific access.

## **Features**

- User registration, login, and logout functionality.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for different roles (Admin, User, Moderator).
